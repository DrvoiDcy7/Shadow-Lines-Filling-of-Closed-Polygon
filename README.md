### I. Description & Design
  The target of this project is implementing an algorithm to fill an arbitrary polygon with shadow lines. Shadow lines are regarded as a set of paralelled slashes with identical interspace, the amount of interspace and slope can be customized.  
   #### Functions:
  (I) Arbitrary polygon with any number or position of edges and vertices  
  (II) Customized interspace and slope  
  (III) Fill the polygon with shadow lines  
### II. Development Environment  
  Visual Studio 2017  
  OpenGL
### III. Instructions
